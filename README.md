# zippy
zippy (Zotero Improvement Package, for Power Yousers) is a plugin for Zotero built by the CSCC01 team Team Hortons.
Our plugin aims to improve the Zotero user experience by implementing the following features:

* Syncing records that live in personal and group libraries
* Introducing custom form builders
* Giving the user the ability to batch edit tags
* ... and more!

As of the time of writing, we have completed initial versions of batch tag editing and group syncing between libraries
