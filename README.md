# ZIPpy
ZIPpy (Zotero Improvement Package, using Python) is a plugin for Zotero built by the CSCC01 team Team Hortons.
Our plugin aims to improve the Zotero user experience by implementing the following features:

* Syncing records that live in personal libraries and group libraries
* Introducing custom form builders
* Giving the user the ability to batch edit tags

# How to install

2. Navigate to the 'zippy' folder
3. Run ```zip -r zippy.xpi .``` 
4. Drag the xpi file onto your Firefox browser
5. Marvel at how our plugin is completely broken!
