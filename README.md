# ZIPpy
ZIPpy (Zotero Improvement Package, using Python) is a plugin for Zotero built by the CSCC01 team Team Hortons.
Our plugin aims to improve the Zotero user experience by implementing the following features:

* Syncing records that live in personal libraries and group libraries
* Introducing custom form builders
* Giving the user the ability to batch edit tags

As of the time of writing, we have only begun to implement syncing records between personal and group libraries.

Keep checking back for more updates to ZIPpy!
